## 🤔 What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. Unlike other word processors, with LaTeX, you don't need to worry about the layout of your document as it does it for you. This makes typesetting mathematical equations especially easy. This collection uses Overleaf, a popular cloud-based LaTeX editor, for easy access and collaboration.
